# Python-challenge
Second Assignment

## Summary 
This assignment included two distinct analyses. The first, PyBank, was an analysis of a company's profit/loss information over the course of several years. The second, PyPoll, was an analysis of election data for four distinct candidates. 

## Process: PyBank
The total amount of months and the total amount of profits and losses were calculated. The changes between each month were then determined, which then allowed for the calculation of the average monthly change, the greatest monthly increase, and greatest monthly decrease. These calculations were then printed in a table and saved as a .txt file.

## Process: PyPoll
First, the unique names of each candidate were determined. Then, the amount of popular votes aquired by each candidate was calculated, followed by the total number of votes and then the percentage of votes each candidate received. Lastly, the winner was determined, and all of these calculations were printed in a table and exported to a .txt file.
